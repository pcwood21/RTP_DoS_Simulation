1) Start MATLAB
2) CD to this folder
3) run startup.m to load files to the path

Figure Guide:
Fig 1: Commented code in base_1500_loads
Fig 2: Run exp1_baseline
Fig 3: Run exp2_dos with commented code block
Fig 4: Run exp2_dos as-is
Fig 5: Run exp3_rpatk
Fig 6/7: (Long exec time) Run exp4_def

NM Code:
In ISO.m, processPrices function runs the state machine
OPTIM.m contains the nelder mead code for different steps
See reference material for what the steps do mathematically
